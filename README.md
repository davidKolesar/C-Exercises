# C Programming Language:

## Introduction:


* The C progamming langauge was created by Dennis ritchie at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1972.
* C was created for the specfic purpose of designing the UNIX operating system. 
* Many programmers used C to solve problems. This resulted in disharmony, so the American National STandards Institute (ANSI) formed a committe in 1983 to create ANSI Standard C. Modern compilers adhere to these standards.
* There was a predecessor language named B (That's why it's called C).


## Why would you use C?

* C is a [Turing-Complete Langauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).
* C is [portable language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_portability).
* C is a mid-level language. Ergo, it's ideal for:
	* drivers
	* kernels
	* low level code
* C is also object-oriented

## What is the lifecycle of a C program?

1. *A programmer writes a disk file creating the source code:* 

  *printf("Helo World");*

 
2. The source code is compiled to create an object file (translating the human readable source code into binary). 
*This is performed by the compiler. This binary is known as object code. The disk file containing them is an [object file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file).*
 
3. The compiled code is linked to create a .exe file. 

*Library functions (such as printf() ) are _predefined functions_. These functions are those which have been defined in advance by the compiler to solve problems that almost every programmer will need (such as printing to the console). The object file produced is linked to the predefined library functions to create the final executable program. This is done with a _linker_.* 




Created examples illustrating basic concepts in C. These include: 

* basic mathematical examples
* basic concepts in C
* debugging exercises
